(1) Advantages of TypeScript
It helps the TypeScript compiler to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development


(2) Difference between Any Type and Unknow Type

Any: The Flexible Type
The any type in TypeScript allows us to use a variable as if it could be any data type. 
We can assign any value to a variable of type any, and we can perform any operation on it without any type checking or error.

Unknown: The Safe Type
The unknown type in TypeScript is similar to the any type, as it can hold any value. 
However, the unknown type is more restrictive than the any type, as it does not allow us to perform any operation on it without first checking its type.

(3) Optional Parameter 
Example: - 
function greet(name:string,id?:number){
    if(id)
        return `Welcome ${name} your id is ${id}`
    else
        return `Welcome ${name}`
}
console.log(greet("Suraj"));
